# Technology Centrality and Stock Market Valuation of Innovations

**Abstract:** We propose a tractable multi-sector dynamic equilibrium model for patent value by incorporating firms' technological spillover effect. We prove that the sectoral-level downstream eigenvalue centrality of the backward citation network is positively related to the value of the individual patent. Empirically, we show a significant positive relationship between patent value and sectoral knowledge spillover based on patentsâ€™ citations from 1971 to 2020 in the United States.
