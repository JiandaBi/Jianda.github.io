# Mandatory Disclosure, Investment Efficiency, and Learning: Evidence from China

**Abstract:** Mandatory disclosure helps increase price informativeness by crowding in the manager's unknown information into the price. In this study, we use the mandatory disclosure regulation of company visits in the Chinese stock market as an exogenous shock to test the learning channel. We find that there is a positive learning effect and the regulated managers increase the firm's investment efficiency by learning from price. Consistent with the learning theory, the learning effect is mainly determined by the information types of disclosure and a higher disclosure precision amplifies this effect. Cross-sectional heterogeneity is also identified across firms with different ownership types and financial constraints. Overall, we provide novel empirical evidence on the learning channel of mandatory disclosure and its positive effect on investment.
